# ChunkDetails
Sends chunk tickets to the client to be viewed.

### Usage
This mod requires installation on the server.
If it is on the client as well as the server, you can use the button in the pause menu to check active chunk tickets.
Otherwise, you can use the command `/logChunk` and tickets will be sent in chat.
